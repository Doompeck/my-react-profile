    <p>
        I am a graduate of Webster University in Saint Louis, Missouri.  I transplanted to Seattle in 2017 and have been finding my way ever since then.  I have continued to find myself in the print and design industry, but have not found my place in the things I really want to do.  
    </p>
    <p>
        I have spent my time during the last 6 months refreshing myself on web development with a goal of getting my own freelance work off the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am excited to move forward with my carrer and life.
